This spreadsheet is very handy tool to keep track of all the trasaction that we do on monthly basis.
You can find basic instructions on how to use this spreadsheet in the excel file itself.

The excel I am attaching in the project is one that you can open in MS Excel, bar graph-Sparkline function won't work in this.
But excel is fully functional with all the formulas baked in to get some information about your savings and spendings.

To leverage full capabilities feel free to use below Google drive link to access Google sheets where you can see bar graph updates
in real time. Here's sheet link:

Future updates:

I might update this spreadsheet to show spending and saving patterns over the course of months in separate sheet of same workbook.
